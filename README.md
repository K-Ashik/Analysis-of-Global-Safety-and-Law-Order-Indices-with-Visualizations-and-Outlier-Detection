# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global safety and law and order indices using datasets derived from various countries. The main objective is to explore the relationship between perceived safety and law order scores, identify patterns, and detect outliers. By comparing these indices, we aim to uncover insights into global safety perceptions and law enforcement effectiveness across different nations.
To facilitate the analysis, we first preprocess the data by ranking countries based on their respective safety and law order scores. We then create interactive visualizations such as world maps and scatter plots to observe geographical trends and correlations between the two indices. Outlier analysis is also conducted to identify countries with unusual patterns—those with high safety but low law order scores and vice versa.
Finally, a correlation analysis is performed to quantify the relationship between safety and law order indices, highlighting regions or countries that stand out. This project provides a comprehensive view of how safety and law order scores vary across the globe, enabling further research into the factors influencing these metrics.
Dataset collected from: Gallup.com
Background Information: A recent Gallup global safety survey has classified Kuwait as the safest country in the world for 2024 regarding individuals walking alone in the streets, with an impressive 99% of respondents reporting they feel safe. Singapore follows in second place with 94%, while Norway and Saudi Arabia both score 92%, reports Al-Seyassah daily.
Kuwait also achieved the highest score on the Law and Order Index, receiving an impressive 98 out of 100, maintaining its position as one of the safest countries in the world since 2019. Additionally, the insurance company Hellosafe has released a “Travel Safety Index,” which rates countries on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the safest countries and 100 the least safe, according to a report by Le Soir. This index is based on 35 criteria, including the occurrence of natural disasters, societal violence, involvement in armed conflicts (both internal and external), and health infrastructure.
